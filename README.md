# Attribuzer

Attribuzer is a simple and customizable attribution system that allows developers to easily provide and display proper attribution for their projects. This setup is intended as a manual example and does not include any APIs or automated endpoints.

## How It Works
1. Include the `attribution.xml` and `attribution.js` files in your project.
2. Add the following HTML where you want the attribution to appear:

   `<div id="attribution"></div>`

3. The JavaScript file will fetch the XML data locally and dynamically display the attribution content.

## Customization
- Modify the `attribution.xml` file to update the project title, creator details, and license information.
- Customize the look of the attribution using CSS in the `style.css` file.

## Manual Setup Instructions

Since this project does not use APIs or endpoints, users will need to clone and set up the files manually:

1. Clone the necessary files (`attribution.xml`, `attribution.js`, `style.css`) to your project folder.
2. Ensure the relative paths are correct when including the JavaScript in your HTML.
3. For example, in your HTML, use the following:

   ```html
   <div id="attribution"></div>
   <script src="./attribution/attribution.js"></script>
   ```

4. Place the files in the correct directory structure on your local server or hosting environment.

## Example Integration

To manually integrate Attribuzer into your project, include the following code in your HTML file:

```html
<div id="attribution"></div>
<script src="./attribution/attribution.js"></script>
```

The JavaScript will load the attribution details from the `attribution.xml` file that you manually set up.
