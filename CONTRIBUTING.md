# Contributing to Attribuzer

We welcome contributions to **Attribuzer**! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features, your input is greatly appreciated. Please take a moment to review these guidelines before contributing.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Since the main branch is locked, start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
   
2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine to make changes:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/juliusthejules/attribuzer.git
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Always create a new branch for your changes. Do **not** make changes directly to the main branch.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-feature-branch
     ```

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   - Make the necessary updates or improvements. Please ensure your code follows the existing style and structure.

5. **Test Your Changes:**
   - Before submitting, ensure that your changes work as expected. If applicable, add tests for any new features or bug fixes.

6. **Commit and Push:**
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Description of your changes"
     ```
   - Push the changes to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-branch
     ```

7. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Once your changes are ready, go to the original repository and open a pull request (PR) from your branch. In your PR description, be sure to:
     - Describe the changes you've made.
     - Reference any related issues or discussions.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Main Branch:** The main branch is locked to ensure stability. All contributions must go through pull requests, which will be reviewed by the maintainers.
- **Pull Requests:** Be sure to open pull requests against the **development branch** (or any designated branch) rather than the main branch.
- **Code Style:** Follow the project's existing code style. Clear, readable, and well-documented code is expected.
- **Commits:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages to document the purpose of your changes.
- **Issue Tracking:** If you find any bugs or want to request new features, please open an issue to start a discussion before submitting a pull request.
